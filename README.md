# 🧮 Java Basic Projects & Calculators

Welcome to my Java learning repository! 🚀
This repository contains a collection of essential Java programs that perform mathematical calculations using user input. I created these while learning Core Java concepts.

## 📂 Included Programs
Here is a list of the tools available in this project:

### 1. ➗ Arithmetic Calculator (`AllArithmeticOperators.java`)
A complete calculator that takes two numbers and performs:
- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/)
- Modulus (%)

### 2. 💰 Simple Interest Calculator (`SimpleInterest.java`)
A financial tool to calculate Simple Interest based on:
- Principal Amount
- Rate of Interest
- Time Period

### 3. 📐 Triangle Area Calculator (`AreaOFTriangle.java`)
Calculates the area of a triangle using the formula `0.5 * Base * Height`.

### 4. 📏 Perimeter Calculator (`Perimeter.java`)
Calculates the perimeter of a quadrilateral shape by summing up the values of all 4 sides provided by the user.
### 5. 🌡️ Temperature Converter (`FahrenheitToCelsius.java`)
A useful tool that converts temperature from Fahrenheit (°F) to Celsius (°C).
- **Formula:** `(Fahrenheit - 32) * 5/9`
- **Features:** Takes user input for temperature and outputs the precise Celsius value.
### 6. ➕➖ Positive, Negative or Zero Checker (`PositiveNegative.java`)
A logic-based program that checks the nature of a number provided by the user.
- It determines if the number is **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Zero**.
- Demonstrates the use of `if-else if-else` conditional statements.

### 7. 🔢 Odd or Even Checker (`OddEven.java`)
A classic beginner program to verify if a number is **Odd** or **Even**.
- **Logic:** Uses the modulus operator (`%`).
- If `number % 2 == 0`, it prints **Even**, otherwise **Odd**.
- 
### 8. 📅 Leap Year Checker (`LeapYear.java`)
A program to determine whether a specific year is a Leap Year or a standard year.
- **Logic:** Validates if a year is divisible by 4.
- **Advanced Logic:** Correctly handles century years (e.g., 2000 is a leap year, but 1900 is not) by checking divisibility by 100 and 400.
  
### 9. 🎓 Student Grade Calculator (`GradeCalculator.java`)
A program that evaluates student performance based on marks obtained.
- **Input:** Takes the marks or percentage from the user.
- **Output:** Assigns a specific Grade (A, B, C, D, or Fail) based on predefined score ranges.
- **Key Concept:** Demonstrates the efficient use of `else-if` ladders to handle multiple conditions.
  
### 10. 🏆 Greatest of Three Numbers (`GreatestOfThree.java`)
A program that takes three numbers as input and identifies the largest among them.
- **Logic:** Compares three variables (A, B, and C) using relational operators.
- **Key Concept:** Demonstrates the use of Logical AND (`&&`) operators combined with `if-else` blocks to efficiently find the maximum value.
  
### 11. ⚙️ Bitwise Operators Showcase (`BitwiseOperators.java`)
A comprehensive program demonstrating the power of Bitwise operators in Java.
- **Operations Covered:**
  - **Bitwise AND (`&`):** Performs logical AND on individual bits.
  - **Bitwise OR (`|`):** Performs logical OR on individual bits.
  - **Bitwise XOR (`^`):** Exclusive OR operation.
  - **Bitwise NOT (`~`):** Inverts all the bits of a number.
    
### 12. ⚡ Odd or Even (Bitwise Method) (`BitwiseOddEven.java`)
An optimized way to check if a number is Odd or Even without using the modulo (`%`) operator.
- **Logic:** Checks the Least Significant Bit (LSB) using `(number & 1)`.
- **Efficiency:** This method is computationally faster than the standard division method.
  
### 13. ✖️ Multiplication Table Generator (`TableGenerator.java`)
A program that prints the multiplication table for any number entered by the user.
- **Input:** Takes an integer (e.g., 5).
- **Output:** Displays the table from 1 to 10 in a structured format.
- **Key Concept:** Demonstrates the use of **Loops** (`for` loop or `while` loop) to perform repetitive calculations efficiently
  
### 14. ❗ Factorial Calculator (`Factorial.java`)
A mathematical program that calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer.
- **Example:** The factorial of 5 (`5!`) is `5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120`.
- **Logic:** Uses a loop (`for` or `while`) to multiply a series of descending integers.
- **Key Concept:** Demonstrates how to use an **accumulator variable** to store results inside a loop.

### 15. 🔢 Sum of Odd Numbers (`SumOfOddNumbers.java`)
A program designed to calculate the sum of all odd numbers up to a specific limit set by the user.
- **Example:** If input is `10`, it calculates `1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 25`.
- **Logic:** Uses a loop to traverse numbers and an `if` condition (`i % 2 != 0`) to filter and add only the odd values.
- **Key Concept:** filtering data inside loops and calculating cumulative sums.
