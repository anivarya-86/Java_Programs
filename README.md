# 🧮 Java Basic Projects & Calculators

Welcome to my Java learning repository! 🚀
This repository contains a collection of essential Java programs that perform mathematical calculations using user input. I created these while learning Core Java concepts.

## 📂 Included Programs
Here is a list of the tools available in this project:

### 1. ➗ Arithmetic Calculator (`AllArithmeticOperators.java`)
A complete calculator that takes two numbers and performs:
- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/)
- Modulus (%)

### 2. 💰 Simple Interest Calculator (`SimpleInterest.java`)
A financial tool to calculate Simple Interest based on:
- Principal Amount
- Rate of Interest
- Time Period

### 3. 📐 Triangle Area Calculator (`AreaOFTriangle.java`)
Calculates the area of a triangle using the formula `0.5 * Base * Height`.

### 4. 📏 Perimeter Calculator (`Perimeter.java`)
Calculates the perimeter of a quadrilateral shape by summing up the values of all 4 sides provided by the user.
### 5. 🌡️ Temperature Converter (`FahrenheitToCelsius.java`)
A useful tool that converts temperature from Fahrenheit (°F) to Celsius (°C).
- **Formula:** `(Fahrenheit - 32) * 5/9`
- **Features:** Takes user input for temperature and outputs the precise Celsius value.
### 6. ➕➖ Positive, Negative or Zero Checker (`PositiveNegative.java`)
A logic-based program that checks the nature of a number provided by the user.
- It determines if the number is **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Zero**.
- Demonstrates the use of `if-else if-else` conditional statements.

### 7. 🔢 Odd or Even Checker (`OddEven.java`)
A classic beginner program to verify if a number is **Odd** or **Even**.
- **Logic:** Uses the modulus operator (`%`).
- If `number % 2 == 0`, it prints **Even**, otherwise **Odd**.
- 
### 8. 📅 Leap Year Checker (`LeapYear.java`)
A program to determine whether a specific year is a Leap Year or a standard year.
- **Logic:** Validates if a year is divisible by 4.
- **Advanced Logic:** Correctly handles century years (e.g., 2000 is a leap year, but 1900 is not) by checking divisibility by 100 and 400.
### 9. 🎓 Student Grade Calculator (`GradeCalculator.java`)
A program that evaluates student performance based on marks obtained.
- **Input:** Takes the marks or percentage from the user.
- **Output:** Assigns a specific Grade (A, B, C, D, or Fail) based on predefined score ranges.
- **Key Concept:** Demonstrates the efficient use of `else-if` ladders to handle multiple conditions.
### 10. 🏆 Greatest of Three Numbers (`GreatestOfThree.java`)
A program that takes three numbers as input and identifies the largest among them.
- **Logic:** Compares three variables (A, B, and C) using relational operators.
- **Key Concept:** Demonstrates the use of Logical AND (`&&`) operators combined with `if-else` blocks to efficiently find the maximum value.
